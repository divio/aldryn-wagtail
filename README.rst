Aldryn Wagtail
==============

|build| |coverage|

An opinionated Wagtail setup bundled as a Divio Cloud Addon.

This package will auto configure Django, including admin and some other basic
packages. It also handles sane configuration of the database connection and
static and media files.

The goal is to keep the footprint inside the Django website project as small
as possible, so updating things usually just means bumping a version in
``requirements.txt`` and no other changes in the project.

This addon still uses the legacy "Aldryn" naming. You can read more about this in our
`support section <https://support.divio.com/general/faq/essential-knowledge-what-is-aldryn>`_.
